# Project Title : Prediction of "Salary_Data.csv" Csvdatset to finds out salary across experience person using SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL.

# Tools & Technology:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python Programming Language
3. Numpy (Python Library)
4. Pandas(Python Library)
5. Matplot(Python Library)
6. Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
### An organization wants predicted output for their employees based on their year of experience,use the particular algorithm of machine learning and predict the futuristic salary.            

# Project Approch
1. *Importing the libraries*
2. *Importing the dataset*
3. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
4. Training the Simple Linear Regression model on the Training set
5. Predicting the Test set results
6. Visualising the Training set results
